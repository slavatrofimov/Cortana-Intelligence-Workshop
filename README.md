# Cortana Intelligence Workshop

This project is used to develop a website with instructions for a Cortana Intelligence Workshop. The actual website is hosted on GitHub at https://slavatrofimov.github.io/Cortana-Intelligence-Workshop/.


## Quick Start Guide Template

This website is an adaptation of a quick-start template (https://github.com/tjvantoll/quick-start-template).

## Setup

Start by running `npm install` to install this templateâ€™s dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

And then run `gulp` to launch the guide in your browser:

```
$ gulp
```

Gulp starts up a development server and launches the quick start guide in it. Gulp also watches for changes to files in the `src` folder (including the chapter Markdown files), and refreshes the site in your browser automatically.

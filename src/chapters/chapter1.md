## Complete the Prerequisites

An Azure subscription and a Power BI account are required to complete the KiZAN Cortana Intelligence workshop. If you do not have these accounts already, this section will walk you through the process of activating free trials.

### Creating a Trial Azure Subscription

> **NOTE:** If you have an Azure subscription already, you can skip this section. If you have a Visual Studio subscription (formerly known as an MSDN account), you get free Azure credits every month. Check out the next section for activating these benefits.

There are several ways to get an Azure subscription, such as the free trial subscription, the pay-as-you-go subscription, which has no minimums or commitments and can be canceled any time or an Enterprise agreement subscription. You can buy an Azure subscription directly from Microsoft or from a Microsoft Value Added Reseller. In this exercise, you'll create a free trial subscription.

> **NOTE:** Power BI Service requires a work email address, which will be different from the account you used to set up a trial Azure subscription. You will be unable to register with a Microsoft account, such as @hotmail.com  or @outlook.com or with other consumer-oriented email accounts.

If you are using your work email address with other Microsoft services (such as Office 365), you will be asked to sign in with your existing account.

<img src="images/chapter1/Power BI Trial/PowerBITrial 4.png" class="img-medium" />

If you do not have an existing account, you will be asked to create one.

<img src="images/chapter1/Power BI Trial/PowerBITrial 5.png" class="img-medium" />

After creating an account or signing in, follow the prompts to complete your sign up for the Power BI account.

At the end of the process, you should be able to reach [your personal Power BI workspace](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/contentlist), which will look something like this:

![Personal Workspace](images/chapter1/Power BI Trial/PowerBITrial 8.png)

> **NOTE:** A free Power BI account will be sufficient to complete the exercises in this workshop. However, you will be unable to share your content or collaborate with other users. Optionally, you may choose to try Power BI Pro free for 60 days. Power BI Pro has all the features of the free version of Power BI, and additional sharing and collaboration features. To try a 60-day free trial of Power BI Pro, sign into Power BI, and try one of the Power BI Pro features, such as create an app workspace or sharing a dashboard. When you try any of these features, you will be prompted to start your free trial.
